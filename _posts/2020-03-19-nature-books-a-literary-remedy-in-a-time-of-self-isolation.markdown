With the increasing spread and damage of this new mutation of coronavirus, people are being forced to stay at home and abandon their usual day-to-day activities. This period of impending self-isolation is particularly dangerous especially for people’s mental health as most individuals see themselves separated from their families and friends, and are unable to leave their homes unless for essential activities. As a result, levels of high stress and anxiety are being experienced on a global scale.

In countries, were self-isolation remains an individual civic choice rather than a governmental imposition, such as in the United Kingdom, nature parks and reserves are remaining open to offer some solace and a place to unwind in these unprecedented times, as nature has been reported to bring joy and mental clarity and help release stress. In a world drowning in panic, nature can be an incredible source of calmness. As _The Guardian_ has shared:

 > Research shows that the time spent in nature is beneficial for mental health and physical health, and current government advice on coronavirus is that people without symptoms or health vulnerabilities can go for a walk outdoors if they stay the recommended two meters away from others.

However, for people in countries on a government-imposed self-isolation period, enjoying a walk in the forest seems like an ideal far removed from reality, and landscape photos posted and shared on social media under the hashtags #everydaywildlife and #solaceinnature are more likely to conduct to plain old envy rather than to positivity and mental clarity. Especially in this particular time of the year, where the weather grows warmer, flowers are blooming and birds are nesting, being in lockdown can feel like you are missing out on the best time to be in and around nature.

Therefore, people have been resorting to nature and gardening books as their literary remedy for self-isolation. As author Lucy Jones affirms, ‘in this new world of uncertainty, nature can be transportive,’ and what better way to avoid the realities of isolation than escaping into an imaginary landscape, or picking up a new hobby and fixing that long-neglected garden?
