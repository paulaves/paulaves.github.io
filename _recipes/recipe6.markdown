- 1 cup of warm water (40ºC)

5. Add olive oil and gently **STIR (REMUEVE)** to combine.
6. Add 2 cups of flour and salt and mix with a spatula until a ball begins to form.
7. Transfer to a floured surface and knead into a smooth dough.
8. Roll dough into your desired shape and gently transfer to a greased pan.
9. Use a fork to gently **PRICK (PINCHA)** the dough all around to prevent air pockets from forming.

12. Bake on the lower rack of your oven for 15 to 20 minutes until the **CRUST (CORTEZA)** looks crispy and lightly browned.
