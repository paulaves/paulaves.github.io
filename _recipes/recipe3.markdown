## Ingredients:
- 2 cups of dry roasted peanuts
- 1-2 tbsp of honey or sugar
- Additional salt to taste

## Method:
1. Place **PEANUTS (CACAHUETES)** in a food processor.
2. Let the food processor run for 4-5 minutes until it reaches a **CREAMY (CREMOSO)**, liquid consistency.
3. Stir in the **HONEY (MIEL)**, or **SUGAR (AZÃšCAR)**, or salt.

## Tips:
- Store in the **FRIDGE (NEVERA)** so that it lasts for longer!
- You can add the peanut butter to a slice of the soda bread or use it as a topping for your banana pancakes!
