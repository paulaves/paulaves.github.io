## Ingredients
- 350g of self-rising flour
- 1 tsp of baking powder
- 2 ripe bananas
- 2 medium eggs
- 1 tsp of vanilla extract
- 250ml of whole milk
- Butter

## Method:
1. Add the flour, **BAKING POWDER (LEVADURA)** and a pinch of salt into a large bowl.
2. In a separate mixing bowl, **MASH (MACHACA)** the ripe **BANANAS (PLÁTANOS)** with a **FORK (TENEDOR)** until smooth.
3. In that same bowl, whisk in the **EGGS (HUEVOS)**, vanilla extract and **MILK (LECHE)**.
4. Make a small well in the centre of the dry ingredients, and pour in the mix of wet ingredients.
5. Whisk together to create a smooth, silky **BATTER (MASA)**.
6. Heat up a small amount of **BUTTER (MANTEQUILLA)** in a pan over medium heat.
7. Add two to three tablespoons of the batter to the **PAN (SARTÉN)** and let it cook for several minutes.
8. The pancake will be ready to be flipped when small bubbles start appearing on the surface.
9. Let cook on the other side for one to two minutes.
10. Repeat the same actions with the remaining batter.
11. Stack the pancakes on a plate and add your favourite toppings on top!
