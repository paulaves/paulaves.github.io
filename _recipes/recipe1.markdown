## Ingredients:
- 3 cups of plain flour
- 1 tsp of baking soda
- ½ tsp of salt
- 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar
- 1 cup of water

## Methods:
1. Preheat the **OVEN (HORNO)** at a temperature of 180ºC.
2. Add all the dry ingredients into a bowl and mix them: the **FLOUR (HARINA)**, the **BAKING SODA (BICARBONATO DE SODIO)**, and the **SALT (SAL)**.
3. Make a small well in the middle and add one cup of **WATER (AGUA)** and one teaspoon of **APPLE CIDER VINEGAR (VINAGRE DE MANZANA)**.
4. Mix all the ingredients until you get a **DOUGH (MASA)** consistency.
5. Use your hands to knead the dough and shape into a round ball.
6. Make two small cuts at the top in the shape of an X.
7. Sprinkle a bit of flour on an oven tray.
8. Transfer your dough into the tray, and coat it with some water to create a **CRISPY (CRUJIENTE)** effect.
9. Leave bread in the oven for approximately 30 minutes.
10. When the bread is ready, take it out of the oven. Wrap it in a kitchen towel and leave it to rest for at least another 30 minutes.
