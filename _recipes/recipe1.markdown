There are variations on this basic recipe, sometimes with no sauce, sometimes with other vegetables. The most common variant in Greece may include zucchini (courgette), part-fried potatoes or sautéed mushrooms in addition to the eggplant.

## 1.1 Pesto

### Ingredients

- 4 cups fresh basil leaves (about 3 large bunches)
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/3 cup pine nuts
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon salt


### Method

Oh the smell of fresh basil! Take a second to enjoy deeply its **GREEN (VERDE)** colour and its aromatic essence. Making homemade pesto is really easy, but good quality ingredients play a very important role in the game.

Combine the first 4 ingredients in a blender. Blend until paste forms, stopping often to push down the basil. Add the Parmesan **CHEESE (QUESO)** and salt; blend until smooth. Transfer to small bowl.

- Tip: This recipe can be made 1 day ahead. Top with a bit of **OLIVE OIL (ACEITE DE OLIVA)** and chill.
- Variations: Keep the ratios in the recipe but you can change the greens, the nuts and the cheese.


## 1.2 Basic Tomato Sauce

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 onion, finely chopped
- 1 small carrot, finely chopped
- 1 small stalk of celery, including the green tops, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley
- 1 clove of garlic, minced
- Chopped fresh basil
- 1 can whole tomatoes, including the juice, or 1 3/4 pound of fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped
- 1 teaspoon tomato paste
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### Method

Heat olive oil in a large wide pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrot, celery and parsley. Give it a good stir.

Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are softened and cooked through.

Add the minced garlic. Increase the heat to medium high. Cook **GARLIC (AJO)** for 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, salt, pepper, then simmer. Add the tomatoes, including the juice and shredding them with your fingers if you are using canned whole tomatoes. Add the tomato paste and the basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Bring to a low simmer, reduce the heat to low and cook, uncover it until thickened, about 15 minutes..

- Variations: The sauce can be dressed up with mushrooms, sausage, olives and all manner of vegetables.


## 1.3 Bechamel or White Sauce

### Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- 2 tablespoons of flour
- 1 1/2 cups of milk, heated
- Salt
- Freshly grounded pepper

### Method

Melt the BUTTER (MANTEQUILLA) in a heavy-bottomed saucepan.

Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste cooks and bubbles a bit, but don't let it brown – about 2 minutes.

Add the hot milk, continuing to stir as the sauce thickens. Bring it to a BOIL (HERVIR). Add salt and pepper to taste, lower the heat, and cook, stirring for 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from the heat.

- Tip: To cool this sauce for later use, cover it with wax paper or pour a film of milk over it to prevent a skin from forming.
- Variations: Stir in 1/2 cup grated Cheddar cheese during the last 2 minutes of cooking to convert it into a cheese sauce.

## 1.4 Basic Mayonnaise

###Ingredients
- 1 egg yolk at room temperature
- 175ml of olive oil

### Method
Place egg yolk in a medium metal bowl. Start whisking the egg while dripping the oil one drop at a time. It's very important to go slow and don't stop whisking.

Once you have added half of the oil, you can start incorporating the rest of the oil faster. If the mayonnaise is getting too thick, you can add a tablespoon of water to help thin it out.

- Tip: You can refrigerate it up to 3 days, well covered.

## 1.5 Herb Mayonnaise

### Ingredients
- 175ml stiff basic mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon of lemon juice
- 4 tablespoons of mixed herbs, finely chopped (parsley, chives, basil, tarragon...)
- 1 garlic clove finely grated
